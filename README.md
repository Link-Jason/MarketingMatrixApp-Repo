# 📊 Marketing Matrix Dashboard
**Project Status:** MVP (Core Functionality Complete)

An interactive web application that transforms the classic BCG Matrix into a visual dashboard for marketers. Designed to help teams analyze product performance, prioritize marketing spend, and justify strategic decisions using clear, data-driven metrics.
